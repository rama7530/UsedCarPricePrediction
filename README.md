Used Car Price Prediction in a Marketing Perspective.
Objective: The main objective of this project is to develop a model that can
predict the price of used cars based on various attributes such as brand, model
year, mileage, fuel type, and other key factors. This can help dealerships and
customers understand pricing trends, allowing for better decision-making when
buying and selling used cars.
